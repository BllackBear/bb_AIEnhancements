In this script, we continuously loop through all vehicles in the game world, identify the AI-controlled vehicles, and modify their driving behavior based on their speed. If the AI vehicle is traveling at a higher speed, we reduce the chance of crashing by adjusting the driving style and slightly increasing the maximum cruise speed. On the other hand, if the AI vehicle is traveling at a lower speed, we increase their awareness and reaction time, ensuring safer driving behavior.
